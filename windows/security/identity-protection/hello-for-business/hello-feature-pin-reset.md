### Onboarding the Microsoft PIN reset service to your Intune tenant

Before you can remotely reset PINs, you must on-board the Microsoft PIN reset service to your Azure Active Directory tenant, and configure devices you manage.

### Connect Azure Active Directory with the PIN reset service

1. Go to the [Microsoft PIN Reset Service Production website](https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=b8456c59-1230-44c7-a4a2-99b085333e84&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.windows.net&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcred.microsoft.com&state=e9191523-6c2f-4f1d-a4f9-c36f26f89df0&prompt=admin_consent), and sign in using the Global administrator account you use to manage your Azure Active Directory tenant.
2. After you have logged in, choose **Accept** to give consent for the PIN reset service to access your account.

3. Go to the [Microsoft PIN Reset Client Production website](https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=9115dd05-fad5-4f9c-acc7-305d08b1b04e&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fcred.microsoft.com%2F&redirect_uri=ms-appx-web%3A%2F%2FMicrosoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin%2F9115dd05-fad5-4f9c-acc7-305d08b1b04e&state=6765f8c5-f4a7-4029-b667-46a6776ad611&prompt=admin_consent), and sign in using the Global administrator account you use to manage your Azure Active Directory tenant.
4. After you have logged in, choose **Accept** to give consent for the PIN reset client to access your account.

> [!NOTE]
> After you have accepted the PIN reset service and client requests, you will land on a page that states "You do not have permission to view this directory or page." This behavior is expected. Be sure to confirm that the two PIN reset applications are listed for your tenant.
